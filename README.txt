Project Overview:

This is a project that I made for my A Level Computer Science coursework. It is a student organiser that uses sqlite3 to store the student's tasks into a database file. The purpose of this program is to allow the user to add in tasks such as: homework, coursework and their exam dates and be able to add notes as well as easily sort them into a chosen order.
